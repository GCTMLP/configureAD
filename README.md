To set up Active Directory, you need to run the scripts one by one
1) network_and_name.ps1
2) AD_and_dns.ps1
3) DNS_zone_DHCP_server.ps1

At the end of each script, a system reboot occurs, as it is required to complete some settings

Settings will be prompted to enter manually in the console when you run each script
